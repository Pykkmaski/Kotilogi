# Kotidok

**Kotidok** is a web service designed to allow users to save renovation information and associated files about their property into a single place.
The service is intended to function on the basis of "events", which modify the current state of a saved property.
Currently supports houses only. Appartment-support might be added in the future.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
